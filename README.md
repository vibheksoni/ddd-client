## üöÄ Overview

**DDDGerman API Client** is a powerful, reverse-engineered Python library for interacting with the [DDDGerman](https://dddgerman.org) learning platform. It enables you to programmatically access, analyze, and manage your German language learning content‚Äîmaking automation, data extraction, and custom workflows a breeze.

Whether you're a student, educator, or developer, this tool unlocks new possibilities for engaging with your learning data.

---

## ü§î Motivation

I originally built this project because I had to complete assignments for a German class and wanted to avoid repetitive manual work. By inspecting the frontend sources of DDDGerman, I figured out how the API works‚Äîallowing me to fetch questions, retrieve and submit answers, and automate the entire process.

To make the codebase more robust and maintainable, I used AI tools to clean up, refactor, and document the client, resulting in a much more readable and user-friendly library.

While I used this API client as the foundation for an AI-powered question solver (which I won't be publishing), I'm sharing the reversed API client itself. This way, you can easily build your own automation, analysis tools, or even your own solver if you wish. The client gives you full programmatic access to your learning data‚Äîwhat you do with it is up to you!

## üö¶ Quick Start

Here's how to get up and running in minutes:

```python
# Ensure ddd_api.py is in your working directory or PYTHONPATH
from ddd_api import DDDGermanPlatform, AuthenticationError, NotFoundError

# 1. Obtain your JWT token:
#    - Log in to dddgerman.org
#    - Inspect network requests for 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>'
jwt_token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"  # Replace with your actual token

# 2. Find your numeric User ID (required for user-specific actions)
user_id = 12345  # Replace with your actual User ID

try:
    client = DDDGermanPlatform(jwt_token=jwt_token)
    print("\nFetching chapters...")
    chapters = client.get_all_chapters()
    if chapters:
        print(f"Found {len(chapters)} chapters.")
        first_chapter = chapters[0]
        # ...explore further as needed...
    else:
        print("No chapters found.")

except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication Error: {e}. Check your JWT token.")
except NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Not Found Error: {e}. Resource missing.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```
